Example:

Use NumPy to create a simple vector as follows:

python

vector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

This line of code creates a vector vector with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The vector is a one-dimensional array, a fundamental structure in NumPy for handling numerical data efficiently.

Answer: The created vector is represented in NumPy as array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), which is a sequence of numbers stored in an ordered collection that can be easily manipulated with NumPy's array operations.
